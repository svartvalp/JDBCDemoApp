In this project I tried to use only jdbc to work with db, and Spring I used only for DI )
So, JDBC is very low-level, and have much of boilerplate. I think that better to use libraries or frameworks over JDBC,
and I made some demo for Thymeleaf, which is very easy to learn and use for making server-side rendering.
